**Appending the text:**
For this function I will first allocate the memory for the new nodes in the linked list. I will then duplicate the input text and assign it to the new node using strdup. I will then set the pointer to NULL for the node nodesince it will be the last node. I will then check if the list is empty or not if it is I will return the new node as the head  and if not I will traverse the list in order to find the last node. Finally, I will attach the new node to the end and return the head of the list. 

**Insert text:**
To solve this problem I will first do the allocation of the memeory for the new node. I will then use an if statement to check if we are inserting at the head of the node if we are then I will adjust the head pointer and return the new head. I will then traverse through the list to the node just before the insertion point. I will then insert the new node into the list right before the specified position and will finally return the list. 

**Delete text:**
To solve this function I will first check if the list is empty. If it is I will return NULL. To handle the deletion of the first node I will use an if statement to move the head of the pointer to the next node and then free the memory for both the text and the node. I will then traverse to the node before the one to delete and the loop will stop either one node before the tarfet or if the end of the list is reached. I will then remove the target node by using a temp pointer and then a next pointer before the target so it is adjusted to bypass the target node. I will finally return the list.


**Replacec text:**
For this function I will first traverse through the nodes in the list to the specified position. I will then free the exitising text in that node and then replace it wil a new copy of the text using strdup. Finally, I will return the head of the list.



**Duplicate text:**
To solve this problem I will first handle the empty list case so it the list is empty I will return NULL. I will then take a copy of the text and create a duplicated list. I will also traverse the original llist and for first node I will allocate memory and copy and text otherwise I will handle memory allocation for the new node and that follows and then I will make the pointer adjustment of the current copy.



**Text length:**
To solve this I will first initlize the count to 0 and then I will traverse through the list and increment the count for eeach node. I will then return the total number of nodes. 


**Stack push duplicate:**
To solve this problem I will first check if the stack is empty and if it is I will return it umnchaged. I will then duplicate the current top node of the text of the stack and then create a new stack node. Finally, I will return the new node as the new top of the stack. 

**Stack push empty:**
To do this problem I will create a new stack node with an empty text node. Then I will return if there is no text at the top, representing any empty state. Lastly I will push it to the next position in the stack and return the position of the new node. 


**Stack pop stack:**
For this problem I will first check if the stack is empty. Then I will store the next item before freeing the current top node. Next, I will free the text linked list at the top of the stack and also free the current stack node. Finally, I will return the next node as the new top node of the stack.
